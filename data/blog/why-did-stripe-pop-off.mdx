## Introduction:
Stripe, the renowned payment processing company, contrary to popular belief, did not achieve success by being the most user-friendly. It was through expansion into peripheral markets, Stripe managed to acquire enough capital to later revolutionize the online payments industry. This short blog explores the early history of Stripe, its journey before the breakthrough, the pivotal moment that led to its explosive growth, and the subsequent aftermath.

## Early History:
Stripe began its journey in August 2010, spending the next fourteen months building the infrastructure necessary for its vision. After extensive development, the company launched publicly on September 30, 2011, with only seven team members. Despite acquiring only 50 users initially (ith 20 of them from Y Combinator), Stripe's public launch did not generate significant growth. Most of their early users were from the Ruby community

## Before the growth:
Stripe initially seemed to target solo small developers. Their API supported a range of features.
By October 10, they had amassed 291 users, including prominent names like Shopify and MongoDB. The company had developed libraries in various programming languages, expanding their reach within the developer community.

## Explosive growth:
On October 10, 2012, Stripe launched Stripe Connect, a product that supervises marketplace transactions. This marked a turning point for Stripe, demonstrating their rapid growth and expanding market reach. Within a month, they showcased notable users such as Shopify, Ballpark, Wufoo, Sumail, and ShopLocket. 

## The aftermath:
In August 2013, Braintree, the most established competitor at the time, followed with their own marketplace solution. However, Stripe's early entry into the market played a vital role in their victory. By late June, Stripe had acquired renowned clients like Lyft, Exec, Sidecar, Postmates, and Homejoy, processing up to $500,000 per day in transactions. This success provided Stripe with substantial revenue and positioned them as a dominant player in the payment processing industry.

## Conclusion:
Stripe's triumph can be attributed to their ability to capture a profitable peripheral market to their original vision. Despite Braintree's three-year head start, Stripe's enterprise solution allowed them to secure a substantial market share and fuel their growth. Furthermore, the rise of mobile technology during this period contributed to Stripe's success, as they capitalized on the growing demand for seamless online payment solutions. Stripe's journey showcases the importance of innovation, timing, and adaptability in building a successful company in a rapidly evolving industry.
